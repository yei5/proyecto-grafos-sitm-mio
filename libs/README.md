# Libraries Required

## JMapViewer

To use the map visualization feature, you need to download JMapViewer:

1. Download JMapViewer from: https://github.com/mstefaniuk/JMapViewer/releases
2. Or use Maven Central: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.openstreetmap/jmapviewer
3. Place the JAR file in this directory (libs/)

The latest version should work. If you can't find it, you can also use:
- Download from: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/openstreetmap/jmapviewer/2.14/jmapviewer-2.14.jar

After downloading, rename it to `jmapviewer.jar` and place it in this directory.
